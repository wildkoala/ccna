Here's what you have to do to get ssh on a cisco router or switch

1. ip domain-name <domain>
2. hostname <WORD>
3. crypto key generate rsa 
4. Add ip address to interface (and no shut)
5. username <WORD> priv <NUM> secret <WORD>
6. aaa new-model
7. enable secret <word>
8. line vty 0 15
9. transport input ssh


On a switch you're still going to set a default gateway, and wont need the aaa new-model command. 
After transport input ssh-
10. password <WORD>
11. login
