Commands for STATIC NAT'ing in Cisco

DYNAMIC COMMANDS AT THE BOTTOM

MAP OF NETWORK 
 --- "inside local" *your router* "outside local"--- INTERNET --- "outside global" *other router* "outside local"--- 
 
// NOTE
For all of these, you must specify first which interface is "inside" and which interface is "outside"

 =================================================================
 Mandatory Beginning Commands
 =================================================================
 int <interface> // this has to be the outside local interface. See diagram above.
 ip nat outside
 int <interface> // this has to be the inside local interface. See diagram above.
 ip nat inside

 Once you've run that, you can do whatever kind of NAT technique you'd like below.
 
 
 
 =================================================================
 1 to 1, static NAT
 =================================================================

 ip nat inside source static <internal ip address> <external ip address>
 
 
 
 =================================================================
 Port Forwarding/Port Address Translation 1 to 1
 =================================================================

 ip nat inside source static <protocol> <internal ip address> <internal port> <external ip address> <external port>



 =================================================================
 NAT Overload Translation 
 =================================================================
 // This is the NAT you usually think about with home routers. You have 1 public IP and all your internal users share it.
 
 access-list <#> permit <network address> <WILDCARD mask>
 ip nat inside source list <#> interface <interface> overload
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 DYNAMIC ADDRESS TRANSLATION
 
 =================================================================
 Mandatory Beginning Commands
 =================================================================
 int <interface> // this has to be the outside local interface. See diagram above.
 ip nat outside
 int <interface> // this has to be the inside local interface. See diagram above.
 ip nat inside
 
 =================================================================
 Rest of commands
 =================================================================
 access-list <#> permit <network address> <WILDCARD mask>
 ip nat pool <name> <starting IP> <ending IP> netmask <netmask>
 ip nat source list <#> pool <pool name> overload
 
 // the pool represents your pool of external IPs, you might just have 1.
 // the overload command means that multiple people can use the same IP, they'll just use different ports.
 
 // you can view the NAT tables with:
 
 show ip nat translations
