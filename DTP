// DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol

// This protocol is used between switches to establish what ports are going to be trunked.
// You'll wanna turn it off on interfaces on a cisco switch that are connected to devices that do not support DTP
// To enable trunking from a cisco switch to a device that does not support DTP, 
// use the switchport mode trunk + switchport nonegotiate.

There are 5 total different trunking modes:

1. switchport mode access
2. switchport mode dynamic auto
3. switchport mode dynamic desirable
4. switchport mode trunk
5. switchport 

To delete a vlan:
no vlan <#>

For routers on sub-interfaces, it's convention to make whatever number comes after the . to be the vlan number.
However, the vlan that you're really in is the one that you gave when you type "encapsulation dot1Q vlan <#>".

Is this protocol enabled by default?? IDK
