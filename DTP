// DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol

// Cisco owns this protocol
// This protocol is used between switches to establish what ports are going to be trunked.
// You'll wanna turn it off on interfaces on a cisco switch that are connected to devices that do not support DTP
    // It won't do anything, and why share the info if you don't have to.
// To enable trunking from a cisco switch to a device that does not support DTP, 
// use the switchport mode trunk + switchport nonegotiate.
// You have to set this stuff up on every interface which would be really obnoxious.

There are 5 total different trunking modes:

1. switchport mode access
2. switchport mode dynamic auto
3. switchport mode dynamic desirable
4. switchport mode trunk
5. switchport 

To delete a vlan:
no vlan <#>

For routers on sub-interfaces, it's convention to make whatever number comes after the . to be the vlan number.
However, the vlan that you're really in is the one that you gave when you type "encapsulation dot1Q vlan <#>".

Is this protocol enabled by default?? IDK, maybe

Dynamic Auto      |   Access      |          Trunk       |   Trunk   |   Access    |

Dynamic Desirable |   Trunk       |          Trunk       |    Trunk  |   Access    |   

Trunk             |   Trunk       |          Trunk       |    Trunk  |      LC     | 

Access            |   Access      |          Access      |    LC     |   Access    | 


To set the mode on your switch, go to the particular interface you want to change and:
switchport mode <mode>

Hacker Notes 
======================================================

- If you set your own switch to "switchport mode dynamic desirable" then, unless the administrator of the other switch
  has explicitly typed in "switchport mode access", you will get a trunk that will enable you to listen to all the VLANs.

- One could theoretically attach a user device to the switch, sniff the traffic for telnet, read out the login credentials to the 
  other network devices and get control of the networking device. You could then update access lists to allow malicious traffic and
  completely pwn a network.
