// EXAMPLE COMMANDS UPFRONT

ip dhcp excluded-address <first ip in range> <last ip in range>

ip dhcp pool <name>
 network <net address> <subnet mask>
 default-router <ip address>
 dns-server <ip address>
 domain-name <something.something>
 
These commands alone will be enough to get DHCPv4 working. Just assign an interface or subinterface on the router
an ip that is within the network you want to send ip addresses to.

// DHCP (for IPv4)

1. Client connects to network
2. Client sends out DHCP Discover Message (broadcasted)
3. Server hears the broadcast, selects an IP and sends back a DHCP OFFER
4. Client gets the offer and response with a DHCP REQUEST
5. Server confirms that client has a good address, called a DHCP Acknowledge.

*6. Later the client can ask to extend their lease
*7. Server confirms you want to keep your lease


RELEVANT COMMANDS:
ip dhcp excluded-address <address>
ip dhcp pool <pool-name>
    network <network>
    default-router <address>
    dns-server <address>
    domain-name <name>
    lease <duration>
no service dhcp
service dhcp
show ip dhcp binding

Configuring a router as a DHCP client:
ip address dhcp (while in the interfaces configuration mode)
ip helper-address (if the dhcp server is in a different broadcast domain)


=================================================================================

DHCP for IPv6

SLAAC - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

1. Client physically connects to the network
2. Client sends a broadcast Router Soliciation message (RS) asking for information
3. Router gets the broadcast and responds with a Router Advertisement (RA). They send these messages every 200s by default after requests.

The RA includes everything that the user needs to create their own good ip address, and then sends it to the router at the very end just to
verify that the address has not been taken by anyone else.

ipv6 unicast-routing

Okay, now that the router is configured to use IPv6, we can do the rest of the config.

You have 3 options for dynamically assigning IPs with IPv6.
  - SLAAC -> instructs the client to just use the information that the router gives them in RA's
  COMMMANDS:
      no ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
      no ipv6 nd other-config-flag
      
  - RA's + DHCPv6 -> The router will give you what you need for an address, but there's a DHCP server with extra info.
  COMMMANDS:
      no ipv6 nd other-config-flag
      
  - Just DHCPv6 (Stateful DHCPv6) -> RA just tells the client nothing, and to simply contact the DHCPv6 server.
  COMMMANDS:
      no ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
 
 
 Stateless DHCPv6 is when the client generates its own IP but asks for everything else from the DHCP server
 Stateful DHCPv6 means that the clients sends a message to the server asking for an IP, which it gets back with other information.

RELEVANT COMMANDS:

ipv6 unicast-routing
ipv6 dhcp pool
ipv6 dhcp server
ipv6 nd other-config-flag (Do this when on an interface)
ipv6 enable (allows neighbor discover)
ipv6 address autoconfig (get an IPv6 address over SLAAC)
show ipv6 interface
ipv6 dhcp relay destination
