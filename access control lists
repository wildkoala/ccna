// Standard ACLs
    - They only filter based on source IP.
    - only use numbers 1-100
    - They have implicit "deny any" at the end.
    - They should be applied as close to the destination as possible to avoid stopping legitimate traffic.
    - There's an "access-list" command in priviledged exec mode, but it doesn't allow you to give multiple lines.
    - After creating the list, you must assign it to an interface with a particular direction.
    - in EXEC mode, you can use the "show access-lists" to view the ACLs and if they've been violated.
    - Use "clear access-list counters" to reset the number of acl violations to 0.
